    <h1>I am like everyone but uniquely me. I’m the kind of person who loves to interact with new people and getting to know different people. Those I love, I love fiercely.  I love people and cherish my time alone. Really passionate about anything I get into. Super loyal to all the people. I’m close to. Good listener and very helpful to people who are in need. I am both simple and complex. I am good at many things and great at none. I love my home and have a constant urge to travel. I am both very practical and very creative</h1>
